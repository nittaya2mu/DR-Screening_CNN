# DR-Screening_CNN
diabetic retinopathy screening using CNN
This project aims to study on diabetic retinopathy prior screening algorithm using CNN.
  * Input dataset (cropped & augmented RGB) - normal / abnormal
  * Preprocessing - NLMD & CLAHE
  * Convert RGB into HSV, YCrCb, and LAB
  * Texture feature extraction - GLCM & LBP
  * Model construction - SVM, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression
  * Extended experiments on CNN + LSTM

# Code Book Descriptions.
